## Features

### In Scope
- **AI-Powered Policy Guidance**: Get 24/7 personalized support for any queries related to policies. Whether it’s understanding a term or asking about cancellation rules, we’ve got you covered.
- **Educational Insights**: Clear, understandable explanations of insurance terms to help users make informed decisions.
- **Chat With Your Policy**: Chat with your current policy documents to get answers without needing to read through the entire document. Just ask your questions and receive answers directly.
- **Multilingual Support**: To accommodate India’s diverse linguistic community, users can chat in any language.
- **Automated Form Filling (Mock)**: AI simplifies the application process by auto-filling forms in a conversational interface, reducing errors and streamlining the experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Our website is optimized for mobile, allowing users to access all features from their phones.

### Out of Scope
- **Legal and Regulatory Advice**: We do not provide legal advice or regulatory guidance on individual policies.
- **Human Agent Support**: The platform is entirely AI-driven and does not include human agent interaction.

### Future Opportunities
- **Seamless Integration**: Envisioned as a component that can integrate into other websites with minimal code, allowing platforms like PolicyBazaar to offer AI-based support for policy questions.
- **Automated Policy Comparison**: Potential to scrape policy details from other websites to let the interface suggest policies based on user needs.

## Challenges We Faced

- **Session Management**: Maintaining context for each user session.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Iterating through multiple prompt designs to create an effective model.
- **File Management**: Ensuring that files do not need to be resent for the same context.
- **Resource Limit**: Working with limited request-per-minute (RPM) capacity, which affected testing for various prompts due to our project’s non-monolithic structure.
